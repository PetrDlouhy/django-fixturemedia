django-fixturemedia
===================

Simple tool to manage media files for fixtures.

Put relative paths in your fixtures, put your media files in a media directory
in you fixtures directory.

Run `collectmedia` and your fixture media will be copied to MEDIA_ROOT.


YMMV
----

Only supports JSON fixtures.


Installation
------------

Add `'fixturemedia'` to your installed apps.


Usage
-----

1. Add relative paths to your fixtures for file / image fields.


        [
            {
                "pk": 1,
                "model": "myapp.mymodel",
                "fields": {
                    "name": "Awesome Sauce",
                    "image": "images/awesome-sauce.jpg"
                }
            }
        ]


2. Add a `media` directory in your fixtures directory. Add the matching
child directories to match the path in the fixture and place your media file
in the appropriate location.


        myapp/
            models.py
            fixtures/
                initial_data.json
                media/
                    images/
                        awesome-sauce.jpg


3. Run `django-admin.py collectmedia` or ``


        ./manage.py collectmedia
        This will overwrite any existing files. Proceed? yes
        Copied images/awesome-sauce.jpg to /tmp/django_media/images/awesome-sauce.jpg


TODO

Convert to better command modeled after the excellent staticfiles app.
Contributions welcome.
